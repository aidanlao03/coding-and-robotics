 *Each one is orgaznized by the functions baseseq1(); and baseseq2(); and baseseq3();
 *Do enjoy! */

 *First goes the switch (if loop keeps the program from running until the switch is flipped)
 *Then each sequence will play from, 1 - 3 as the song only follows three distinct melodys
 *After that it loops back as the song also follows a loop and come back to origianl melody and repeats */
